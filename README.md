## Problem Summary:
### Our goal is to place rectangular paintings of different prices and sizes on a 1024 x 768 wall. Given a set of art pieces that we could potentially place on the wall, we will try to find out a way that would maximize the value (price) on that wall. The paintings can't be rotated, and every piece is guaranteed to fit on the wall.
