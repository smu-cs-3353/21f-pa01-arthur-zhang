## Problem Summary:
   Our goal is to place rectangular paintings of different prices and sizes on a 1024 x 768 wall. Given a set of art pieces that we could potentially place on the wall, we will try to find out a way that would maximize the value (price) on that wall. The paintings can't be rotated, and every piece is guaranteed to fit on the wall.
###   To solve the problem, 
  we could break down the process of hanging a painting on the wall into two sections. The first is a way to "place the painting" in an order that could optimize space efficiency. By inserting more images we could find more optimal ways to place the paintings. The second part of this process is that we need three different algorithms to try for the most optimized placement. These algorithms would be eventually sharing the same insertion method but the results may vary based on the sequence of us placing in paintings. And the three algorithms are:
###   Brute Force:
###   Most Expensive Picture First:
###   Custom Bin Packing:
